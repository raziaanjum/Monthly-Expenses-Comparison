# Monthly-Expenses-Comparison
# Summary of Monthly Expenses Comparison Project

The "Monthly Expenses Comparison" project was designed to help visualize and compare 
various expense categories over different months. The main objective is to gain insights 
into how spending patterns fluctuate in areas such as food, transportation, and education. 
By utilizing a bar plot, we are able to create a clear visual comparison of expenses for each 
month and category, allowing for easier identification of any trends or outliers.

# Why This Project Was Created ?
1. Expense Tracking: To provide an effective tool for monitoring and managing personal or household expenses.
2. Data Visualization: To demonstrate how bar plots can be used to present numerical data for easy comparison.
3. Financial Planning: To help users identify which categories might require adjustments in their spending habits over time.

# Results Achieved
1. Comparison of Expense Categories: The project successfully highlights how spending 
in each category (Food, Transportation, Education) changes across the months. 
2. Identifying Patterns: Through the visualization, we can spot which months have higher 
expenditures and which categories are the most costly.
3. Insights for Budgeting: The data provided helps users identify areas where they may 
need to allocate more or less budget, ultimately supporting better financial decisions.

Overall, the project illustrates the importance of tracking expenses and how data visualization 
can simplify the process of financial management.
